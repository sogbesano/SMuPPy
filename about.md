SMPP REST API is an encapsulation of the [cloudhopper-smpp](http://github.com/twitter/cloudhopper-smpp "Cloudhopper SMPP") project. Cloudhopper was acquired by Twitter, and since Twitter have opensourced their code. Hooray. I have worked a lot with various SMPP implementations and found that cloudhopper seemed to be the cleanest of the bunch, and decided to expose a RESTFul API around it. This is useful for ESME use-cases and simplifies deployment operations. Check the documentation, and if you have questions submit an issue and I'll try to answer as soon as I can.
